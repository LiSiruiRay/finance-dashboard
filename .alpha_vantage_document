TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY Trending

This API returns current and 20+ years of historical intraday OHLCV time series of the equity specified, covering pre-market and post-market hours where applicable (e.g., 4:00am to 8:00pm Eastern Time for the US market). You can query both raw (as-traded) and split/dividend-adjusted intraday data from this endpoint. The OHLCV data is sometimes called "candles" in finance literature.


API Parameters
‚ùö Required: function

The time series of your choice. In this case, function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY

‚ùö Required: symbol

The name of the equity of your choice. For example: symbol=IBM

‚ùö Required: interval

Time interval between two consecutive data points in the time series. The following values are supported: 1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 60min

‚ùö Optional: adjusted

By default, adjusted=true and the output time series is adjusted by historical split and dividend events. Set adjusted=false to query raw (as-traded) intraday values.

‚ùö Optional: extended_hours

By default, extended_hours=true and the output time series will include both the regular trading hours and the extended (pre-market and post-market) trading hours (4:00am to 8:00pm Eastern Time for the US market). Set extended_hours=false to query regular trading hours (9:30am to 4:00pm US Eastern Time) only.

‚ùö Optional: month

By default, this parameter is not set and the API will return intraday data for the most recent days of trading. You can use the month parameter (in YYYY-MM format) to query a specific month in history. For example, month=2009-01. Any month in the last 20+ years since 2000-01 (January 2000) is supported.

‚ùö Optional: outputsize

By default, outputsize=compact. Strings compact and full are accepted with the following specifications: compact returns only the latest 100 data points in the intraday time series; full returns trailing 30 days of the most recent intraday data if the month parameter (see above) is not specified, or the full intraday data for a specific month in history if the month parameter is specified. The "compact" option is recommended if you would like to reduce the data size of each API call.

‚ùö Optional: datatype

By default, datatype=json. Strings json and csv are accepted with the following specifications: json returns the intraday time series in JSON format; csv returns the time series as a CSV (comma separated value) file.
